# Development environment installation script

## What is it doing ?

The script is an entry point to build Navitia. It allows you to install the Navitia dependencies and build it.
It's cross-platform and modular. If your distribution is not available, do not hesitate to add it in the script. You should easilly be able to do it, following its design.

The script is interactive and allows you to do what you want, how you want it. Moreover, any question can be skipped if you don't want to do a part.


## Requierements

The installation script just needs Bash to run. It's commonly installed on every modern system, you probably don't have to do anything.
However, if you have trouble, try to install Bash for your operating system and re-run it.

For any questions, you can find help on https://www.navitia.io/


## Usage

You just have to be in the script directory and run :
